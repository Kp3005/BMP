# PricePared.com - Price Comparison Web application

This is a price comparison web app that allows the customers to compare prices of general grocery items
sold by multiple retail stores like D-mart accross your city. Those looking to save money on
purchases are more likely to use a price comparison tool to help them with their research.
This not only saves money but saves time as well.
The primary actors of our website are;-
1. Customers
2. Admin (manages all the stores)
3. Updates Manager (for each store updates prices)
4. Counter Manager (for each store works like a cashier)
